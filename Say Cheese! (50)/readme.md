## Selfie.jpg

The first thing I did was take note on what I am looking for:
*make and a model for device that took the selfie*
nicc{MakeWord1_MakeWord2_ModelWord1_ModelWord2}

From there I searched up, *data of photo*, the first link gives us a EXIF data viewer.

I opened the link, uploaded the photo and was presented with some metadata on the image. The data presents us with the camera's make and model
Insert image


Now that we have the make and model of the camera, all we have to do now is just combine them into the desired flag format and submit it!
