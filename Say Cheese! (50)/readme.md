The first thing I did was take note on what I am looking for:
<br>
*make and a model for device that took the selfie*
<br>
*nicc{MakeWord1_MakeWord2_ModelWord1_ModelWord2}*

From there I searched up, "*data of photo*", the first link gives us a EXIF data viewer.

I opened the link, uploaded the photo and was presented with some metadata on the image. The data presents us with the camera's make and model
<br>

Now that we have the make and model of the camera, all we have to do now is just combine them into the desired flag format and submit it!

```nicc{Security_Camera_Kmart_Special}```
